"""Rewrite Tumult Labs copyright notices based on when each file was written.

Reads the table produced by ``copyright_dates.py``. For each file:

* If it was first written in or before June 2025, every notice becomes
  "Copyright Tumult Labs <year> - 2025, and the Tumult Analytics Contributors
  2025-present", where <year> is the year the file was first written.
* Otherwise, every notice becomes "Copyright the Tumult Analytics
  Contributors".

Files not in the table are left alone.
