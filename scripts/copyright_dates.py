"""Find when each file with a Tumult Labs copyright notice was first written.

Writes a tab-separated table with one row per file:

    path    first_added (YYYY-MM)    commit    note

The first-added date follows the file across renames and moves (using
``git log --follow``). Git's rename detection misses some moves, such as one
file being split into several, or code being moved into a new file while
it is rewritten. To catch these, if a new file shares enough lines with a
file deleted in the same commit (ignoring imports and comments), the date is
taken from that deleted file instead (recursively), and the ``note`` column
says so. Review the table, edit ``first_added`` by hand if needed, then pass
it to ``update_copyright.py``.
